Implement a React component for 	displaying a list of user accounts.
Each user account should 	display the following information:
Username
Email
Role (admin/user)
Implement functionality to 	fetch user data from a mock API (you can use fetch or any library 	like Axios).
Implement validation for user 	input fields (username, email) to ensure they are not empty and 	follow a valid format.
Implement functionality to add 	a new user, update an existing user, and delete a user. These 	actions should also update the UI accordingly without refreshing the 	page.
Utilize React hooks where 	applicable.
Style the dashboard using CSS 	to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
